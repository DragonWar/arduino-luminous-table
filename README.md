### Description
I would like to customize my IKEA coffee table with RGB leds. I already saw many kind of projects/videos like this but I want share my modest work. I'm currently using 200 RGB leds (resolution: 20 x 10). I also added two buttons and an potentiometer to control the display mode and the brightness. All this stuff is used with an Arduino. My current aim is to add an interactive system (infrared light based ?) to control LEDs by touching the table with the hand.


### Shopping list
* RGB led string: "WS2811 DC5V full color 50pcs a string ws2801 led pixel module" (~$13.00 the string of 50 RGB led)
* Led power supply: "5V 12A 60W Switching Power Supply 120 / 240V AC (~$8.00)
* Arduino (I'm using an Arduino Uno R3, but it should work with any kind of Arduino I think...)
* Ikea table 'LACK model': 90 x 55 cm (~$35.00)
